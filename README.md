# Home Screen Widgets
[App widgets](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html) can be thought of as a small window or controller for an Android app that can be embedded in another application (like the home screen). They can be very useful, allowing users to view or control an app without actually launching it. The great thing about widgets is that they can be updated automatically (after a time period), or in response to user action. These views are referred to as Widgets in the user interface, and you can publish one with an App Widget provider. An application component that is able to hold other App Widgets is called an App Widget host.
